Purpose of Project: 

Customer attrition, also known as customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers. In this project, I aim to apply my data science knowledge in a real-world context, specifically through customer survival analysis and building a predictive model to predict churning. This learning opportunities is backed by secondary sources as cited below.

Components of the Directory:
1. 1_preprocessing.ipynb - Data quality and assessment of “telecom churn (cell2cell)” dataset from KaggleHub.
2. 2_EDA.ipynb - Explore the cleaned dataset to find patterns and trends that differentiate a churning and non-churning customer.
3. 3_modeling.ipynb - Creating churn prediction models data to predict the likelihood of the current customer leaving.
4. README.txt
