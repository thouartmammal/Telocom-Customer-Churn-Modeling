(Incompleted README - README will be finished once 3_Churn_modeling.ipynb is completed.)

Purpose of Project: 

Components of the Directory:
1_Churn_preprocessing.ipynb - Data quality and assessment of “telecom churn (cell2cell)” dataset from KaggleHub.

2_Churn_EDA.ipynb - Explore the cleaned dataset to find patterns and trends that differentiate a churning and non-churning customer while calculating key metrics.

3_Churn_modeling.ipynb - Creating churn prediction models data to predict the likelihood of the current customer leaving.
